## 📌 Project Overview: **VotexChain – A Blockchain-Based Voting System**

**Objective:**  
Develop a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electronic voting system leveraging blockchain technology. The system aims to facilitate remote voting while ensuring voter anonymity, data integrity, and real-time result tracking.

---

## 🎯 Core Functional Requirements

1. **Voter Registration & Authentication**
   - **Registration:** Users can register using verifiable credentials (e.g., national ID, email).
   - **Authentication:** Implement secure login mechanisms, possibly integrating biometric verification or digital ID validation.
   - **Eligibility Verification:** Ensure only eligible voters can participate in elections.

2. **Election Management**
   - **Create Elections:** Admins can set up elections with details like title, description, start/end dates, and list of candidates.
   - **Manage Candidates:** Add, update, or remove candidates for each election.
   - **Schedule Elections:** Define the timeline for each election phase.

3. **Voting Process**
   - **Vote Casting:** Registered voters can cast their vote for a candidate during the election period.
   - **One-Person-One-Vote:** Ensure each voter can vote only once per election.
   - **Anonymity:** Maintain voter anonymity while ensuring vote authenticity.

4. **Result Tallying & Display**
   - **Real-Time Tallying:** Automatically count votes as they are cast.
   - **Result Display:** Present election results in a user-friendly format upon election completion.

5. **Audit & Transparency**
   - **Immutable Records:** Store all transactions on the blockchain to prevent tampering.
   - **Audit Trail:** Maintain a transparent and verifiable record of all voting activities.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Requirements

- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- **Smart Contract Security:** Ensure smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant data protection and electoral laws.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Optional, for user interface)
- **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js framework)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Smart contracts written in Solidity)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Managed via Prisma ORM)
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Ethers.js
- **Smart Contract Development:** Hardhat
- **Authentication:** JWT or OAuth 2.0
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS/GCP for hosting
